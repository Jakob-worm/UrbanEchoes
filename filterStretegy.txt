# Bird Call Noise Filtering Strategy for Flutter App

## Technical Approaches to Isolating Bird Calls

### 1. Spectral Subtraction Technique
- Utilize spectral subtraction algorithms to remove background noise
- Create a noise profile by analyzing quiet sections of the recording
- Subtract this noise profile from the full recording
- Effective for stationary background noises like wind or ambient environment sounds

### 2. Machine Learning-Based Noise Reduction
- Train a deep learning model (CNN or LSTM) to:
  - Recognize bird call spectral signatures
  - Distinguish between bird calls and other sounds
- Potential frameworks:
  - TensorFlow Lite for Flutter
  - Keras with audio preprocessing libraries
- Requires a large dataset of labeled bird call recordings

### 3. Frequency-Based Filtering
- Most bird calls occur in specific frequency ranges (typically 2-8 kHz)
- Implement bandpass filters to:
  - Remove low-frequency rumbles
  - Cut out high-frequency environmental noise
- Use libraries like `audio_processing` in Dart/Flutter

### 4. Energy-Based Detection
- Analyze sound energy and temporal characteristics
- Identify short, distinct sound events typical of bird calls
- Threshold-based approach to isolate potential bird call segments

### Recommended Implementation Steps
1. Preprocessing
   - Convert audio to spectrogram
   - Normalize audio amplitude
   - Apply initial noise reduction

2. Feature Extraction
   - Extract spectral features
   - Compute mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
   - Analyze temporal dynamics

3. Noise Reduction Techniques
   - Combine multiple approaches:
     * Spectral subtraction
     * Frequency filtering
     * Machine learning classification

### Flutter/Dart Libraries to Consider
- `audio_processing`
- `just_audio`
- `audio_waveforms`
- TensorFlow Lite for mobile ML

### Potential Challenges
- Variability in bird call recordings
- Complex acoustic environments
- Computational overhead of advanced filtering
